## MDA Aesthetic Goals

### 1. Challenge

While playing this game, the player should encounter waves of zombies of increasing difficulty as the game progresses.

#### What does success in this goal look like?

Success in this goal would have the player fail occasionally, but still allow for opportunities to learn, analyze, and iterate upon strategies
to then progress to the next level.

#### What does failure in this goal look like?

Failure would have the player either feel boredom because the game feels to easy or have the player feel frustration due to the game being too
difficult to progress through.

### 2. Self-Discovery

The player should be be able to decide for themselves what kind of weaponry and strategy best suits the situation as the game progresses in difficulty.

#### What does success in this goal look like?

Success in this category would have the player using a variety of weapons at different stages of the game.

#### What does failure in this goal look like?

Failure in this category would have the player only using just one or two weapons for the entirety of the game.

## Core Loop

1. Kill zombies
2. Pick up coins
3. Purchase new weapons and upgrades

As zombies spawn in hoards of increasing number and varying types, the player needs to ensure that they maximize their chance of survival by spending coins they received from killing zombies on upgrading their weaponry and acquiring various upgrades. While the players should have the freedom to pick upgrades and weapons that fits their playstyle, they still need to do so in a way that will allow them to progress through the levels.
